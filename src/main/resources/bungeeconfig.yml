# If you're running a "cracked" server, player data might not be stored properly, and thus, you are on your own.
# If you run your server in offline mode, you might have to reset your player data when switching to online mode!
# If you see this warning by accident and you are using BungeeCord, make sure you have properly setup IP Forwarding.

# No player data will be saved in offline mode unless you set this acknowledgement to 'true'
